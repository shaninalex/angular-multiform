# Multyform

To practice to work with forms in Angular I create this example application - 
job candidates database, where users can submit short information about themselfs, 
select skills, pick a job thay want to get from the list and app will store it 
in database. Administrators can see candidates list, and accept/reject candidates 
with reason message.

Form submittion and validation example. Also example of implementing input and 
validation components ( to prevent masive and complex html templates)
